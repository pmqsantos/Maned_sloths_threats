Our objective was to analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of the main anthropogenic drivers of habitat loss for <i>Bradypus torquatus</i> and <i>Bradypus crinitus</i>, two endangered and endemic species to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used land-use information associated with seven major IUCN-based threats to sloths, covering a three-generation time window (1988–2020), to quantify the current area occupied, temporal changes, heterogeneity, and intensity of drivers across species distributions. We found that cattle farming and ranching dominate the range of both species (from 49% to 56%) and cover an area larger than the remaining native forest. Other drivers also represent important spatial and temporal features of land conversion across species distributions. Driven mainly by livestock expansion, both sloth species have experienced a significant loss of forest cover (<i>Bradypus torquatus</i> – 659098.70ha; <i>Bradypus crinitus</i> – 139013.20ha) in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Overall, <i>Bradypus torquatus</i> showed a higher rate of deforestation than forest regeneration, whereas forest gains outweighed habitat loss for <i>Bradypus crinitus</i>. Our results show that a substantial area of native forest – essential for strictly arboreal species – is being continuously replaced by cattle ranching and agricultural activities, which may lead to population isolation and decline, threatening the long-term population viability.
